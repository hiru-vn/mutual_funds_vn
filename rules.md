Benefits for You (as someone with Dart/Flutter background):
Type Safety: Now your IDE will provide better autocomplete and catch type errors at compile time
Code Clarity: Anyone reading the code immediately knows what types they're working with
Better Debugging: Type errors will be caught early instead of runtime issues
Performance: Dart can optimize better with explicit types vs dynamic types
Maintainability: Future developers (including yourself) will understand the code faster
Fixed Methods:
âœ… _createPieSections() - Now uses List<MyFundsData>
âœ… _createLegends() - Now uses List<MyFundsData>
âœ… _createStockSections() - Now uses List<StockHolding>
âœ… _createStockLegends() - Now uses List<StockHolding>
âœ… _createIndustrySections() - Now uses List<IndustryHolding>
âœ… _createIndustryLegends() - Now uses List<IndustryHolding>
The code is now much more type-safe and follows Dart/Flutter best practices! ðŸŽ¯
